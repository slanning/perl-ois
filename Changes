0.10  2013-05-13
- updated to version 1.3.0 of OIS

0.05  2009-09-15
- updated to version 1.2.0 of OIS
  (needs more work...)

0.04  2007-12-04
- fixed MouseState (I was doing "new MouseState", which meant that
  any time you set width or height it wouldn't actually affect
  the MouseState of the Mouse object itself...)

0.03  2007-09-02
- KeyEvent, MouseEvent wrapped
- MouseEvent no longer segfaults (I think)

0.02  2007-08-30
- fixed setEventCallback for Keyboard, Mouse, and JoyStick classes,
  along with the PerlOIS*Listener classes

0.01  2007-08-28
- first release
